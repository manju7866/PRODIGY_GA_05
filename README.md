# Neural Style Transfer with Google Colab

This project demonstrates the use of **Neural Style Transfer** to apply the artistic style of one image (e.g., a famous painting) to the content of another image (e.g., a photograph). This is implemented using TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, and Google Colab.

## Overview

Neural Style Transfer is a technique used to manipulate and blend images. By combining the content of one image and the style of another, we can create artistic renditions of images. The following steps describe how you can upload your own images and use neural style transfer to generate a stylized image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Hub
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- Google Colab

### Install Required Libraries

First, ensure that all necessary libraries are installed by running the following commands in your Colab notebook:

```bash
!pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub matplotlib
